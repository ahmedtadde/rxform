# RxForm

> Minimal , declarative, and event driven form handling library

- **Declarative:** flexible options to handle simple and complex form logic
- **Reactive:** form element => stream of `values`, `status`, and `errors` records
- **Framework Agnostic:** can be used on any JS frontend application.

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

```sh
npm install --save rxform
```

Then with a module bundler like [rollup](http://rollupjs.org/) or [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), use as you would anything else:

```javascript
// using ES6 modules
import RxForm from 'rxform'

// using CommonJS modules
const RxForm = require('rxform')
```

The [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/rxform/dist/rxform.umd.js"></script>
```

You can find the library on `window.RxForm`.  

**Note**: The lovely package [`mitt`](https://github.com/developit/mitt) is used for event handling. However, `rxform` does not require installation of `mitt`.

## Usage

```typescript
import rxform from 'rxform';

const config: RxFormConfig = ...
const form: RxForm  = rxform(config);

form.stream$.on('form@values', (values: any) => {
  //Inspect new form values state...
  //Then, update UI or someting...
});

form.stream$.on('form@status', (status: any) => {
  //Inspect new form fields' intercation statuses...
  //Then, update UI or someting...
});

form.stream$.on('form@errors', (errors: any) => {
  //Inspect new form errors generated from computed form values...
  //Then, update UI or someting...
});

//... When done, clean up
form.destroy();


```

## Examples

```TO DO```

## Configuration

- `target: string | HTMLFormElement`
DOM selector or element of the form. Required.
<br/>
- `onsubmit: (values: FormValues, errors: FormErrors, status: FormStatus, dispatch: FormDispatch) => void`
Form submission handler. Required.

  ```typescript
  type FormValues = Record<string, Readonly<any>>;
  type FormErrors = Record<string, Readonly<any>>;
  type FormStatus = {
    /*
    - A form field is labelled as `touched` when after its first blur event is triggered.
    - A form field is `modified` when after the first time its input value changed.
    */
    fields: { [name: string]: Record<'touched' | 'modified', boolean> };
    submitting: boolean;
  };
  ```

<br/>

- `values.state: Record<string, Readonly<any>>`
Initial form values state object. Required.
<br/>

- `values.providers: FormValuesProvider[]`
Array of objects that act as an instruction manuals on how to compute form values based on user inputs. Required.

  ```typescript

  type FormValuesProvider = string | [string, string | boolean] | [string, string, boolean] | {

     /* some DOM selector string used to capture some form field elements.*/
    selector: string;

    /* after provider fn completes computation, it uses this value as the type of the payload passed to the `values.reducer` function. Uses `selector` as default */
    dispatch?: string;

    /* whether `selector` is meant to capture one or many form field elements. Is `false` by default. */
    multiple?: boolean;

    /* For the form field elements matched by the `selector`, list of form events that trigger this provider. If `false`, provider never runs. Defaults to ["change", "blur"] */
    events?: false | DOMEvents[];

    /* Custom function to extract data from each form field element capured by `selector`. Defaults to standard parsing  */
    parser?: ($field: DOMFieldElementsType) => any;

    /* Custom function provided to transform extracted data from a form field element. No default behavior. */
    transformer?: (resultFromParser: any) => any;
  }

  enum DOMEvents {
    FOCUS = "focus",
    INPUT = "input",
    CHANGE = "change",
    BLUR = "blur",
    SUBMIT = "submit",
    RESET = "reset"
  }


  type DOMFieldElementsType =
    | HTMLInputElement
    | HTMLSelectElement
    | HTMLTextAreaElement;
  ```

  Besides passing an object, here are other ways to specify a form values provider:

  - `string => selector`
  - `[string, string] => [selector, dispatch]`
  - `[string, boolean] => [selector, multiple]`
  - `[string, string, boolean] => [selector, dispatch, multiple]`

<br/>

- `values.reducer: FormValuesReducer`
  A typical state reducer function. Takes the previous/current form values and an action object where the `type` is some provider's `dispatch` option.

  ```typescript
  type FormValuesReducer = (previousState: FormValues, action: FormValuesReducerPayload) => FormValues;

  type FormValuesReducerPayload = {
    type: string;
    value: any,
  }
  ```

<br/>

- `errors.state: Record<string, Readonly<any>>`
Initial form errors state object. Defaults to plain empty object `{}`.
<br/>

- `errors.providers: FormValuesProvider[]`
Array of objects that act as an instruction manuals on how to compute form values based on user inputs. Required.

  ```typescript

  type FormErrorsProvider = string | [string, (...args: any[]) => boolean] | [string, (...args: any[]) => boolean, string | ((...args: any[]) => string)] | {

    /* after provider fn completes computation, it uses this value as the type of the payload passed to the `errors.reducer` function. Required. */
    dispatch: string;


     /* Error message for validation failure. Defaults to a generic error message */
    message?: string | ((input?: any, values?: FormValues, errors?: FormErrors, status?: FormStatus) => string);

    /*
    Custom function to build input passed to validator function.
      case string => formValues[key];
      case string[key1, key2, key3, ....] => [formValues[key1], formValues[key2], formValues[key3], ...];
    Defaults to a function returning the whole form values object.
    */
    input?: string | string[] | ((values?: FormValues, errors?: FormErrors, status?: FormStatus) => any);

    /* Custom function to determine whether error provider should run or not. Defaults to a function that always returns `true` */
    predicate?: (values?: FormValues, errors?: FormErrors, status?: FormStatus) => boolean;

    /* Custom function to validate result from `input` function. Defaults to a function that returns `true` => no errors. */
    validator?: (input?: any, values?: FormValues, errors?: FormErrors, status?: FormStatus) => boolean;
  }

  ```

  Besides passing an object, here are other ways to specify a form errors provider:

  - `string => dispatch`
  - `[string, function] => [dispatch, validator]`
  - `[string, function, string] => [dispatch, validator, message]`
  - `[string, function, function] => [dispatch, validator, message]`

<br/>

- `errors.reducer: FormErrorsReducer`
  A typical state reducer function. Takes the previous/current form errors and an action object where the `type` is some provider's `dispatch` option.

  ```typescript
  type FormErrorsReducer = (previousState: FormErrors, payload: FormErrorsReducerPayload) => FormErrors;

   type FormErrorsReducerPayload = {
    type: string;
    error: {
        context: {
            errors: FormErrors,
            input: any,
            status: FormStatus,
            values: FormValues
        },
        message: string
    } | null,  /* is `null` when validation result is ok */
  }
  ```
